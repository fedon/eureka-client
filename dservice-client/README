This project is mainly to illustrate protective semantics support for HysCmd classes replacement.

The semantics is demonstrated in DclientJerseyProxy class. IT is runnable. The only argument it accepts is server URI prefix. Client is configured to use
matrixREST-jersey project https://github.com/fedon/RESTInjection/tree/master/jersey/server.
If you run the server with maven

mvn jetty:run,

then DclientJerseyProxy should be run with argument

/matrixREST-jersey/jersey.

One of the server methods matrix.single() is implemented with 10 seconds pause to provide better asynchronous experience.
